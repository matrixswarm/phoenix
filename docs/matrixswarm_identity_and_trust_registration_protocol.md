MatrixSwarm Identity & Trust Registration Protocol

Overview

This document outlines the final design and operational doctrine for secure agent identity registration within the MatrixSwarm architecture. It defines the use of asymmetric and symmetric encryption for boot integrity, identity verification, packet encryption, and decentralized recovery operations.

🔐 Core Principles

Identity Verification:

Each agent generates its own asymmetric keypair (secure_keys)

Agents sign a bootsig ("agent agent_doctor-1 booted at TIMESTAMP") using their private key

The signed bootsig proves that the agent owns the private key for the claimed identity

Controlled Visibility:

The signed bootsig is encrypted using Matrix's public key

Only Matrix (and trusted sentinels) can decrypt and verify the identity

Matrix-Signed Swarm Trust:

Matrix generates a symmetric swarm_key at site boot

This key is distributed to all spawned agents and is used to encrypt all swarm-level packet payloads

Matrix's public key is also included in each agent's vault for verification

Vault Integrity:

A SHA256 fingerprint of the full vault payload is generated and stored alongside the encrypted vault

On decrypt, the fingerprint is recalculated and compared

If the fingerprint fails to match, the vault is flagged as tampered and the agent halts

🌀 Universe-Bound Trust Material

Matrix Keypair: Public and private keys are generated once at site boot and stored in Matrix's vault

Swarm Key: AES-256 key generated per universe

Agent Keypair: Each agent generates its own keypair on spawn

Agent Vault Includes:

{
  "secure_keys": { "pub": "...", "priv": "..." },
  "swarm_key": "base64...",
  "matrix_pub": "...",
  "fingerprint": "sha256..."
}

🎓 Registration Flow

1. Agent Boot:

Agent signs its bootsig with its private key

Encrypts the signed bootsig using Matrix's public key

Submits a register_identity command with the encrypted identity payload

2. Matrix:

Decrypts the identity payload with her private key

Verifies the signature using the agent's public key

Stores the agent's pubkey, fingerprint, bootsig in pubkeys.json

Signs pubkeys.json with her private key to lock the registry

3. Sentinels:

Each sentinel holds Matrix's public, private, and swarm keys

Flag: "matrix_secure_verified": true

Can assist in rekey operations if Matrix crashes

Can restore Matrix's vault and swarm_key from signed backup

🌐 Packet Encryption

All packets are encrypted using the swarm-wide AES-256 key

This key is shared with all agents via the vault

Agents use the key to encrypt reflex .msg, command .cmd, Redis messages, or inter-agent streams

SWARM_KEY is passed in environment and used for AES-GCM operations

⚖️ Security Enforcement

Check

Enforced

Vault SHA fingerprint

✅ Yes

bootsig signature match

✅ Yes

Matrix pubkey consistency

✅ Yes

Packet encryption

✅ Optional by layer

Registry signing

✅ Yes

Sentinel recovery of Matrix

✅ Yes

✈️ Failure Protocol

If Matrix boots and:

Vault is missing or fingerprint mismatch → Sentinel provides recovery vault

Sentinel unavailable or vault is invalid → Matrix triggers swarm-wide reaper node

[MATRIX][FATAL] Vault decryption failed — swarm integrity unknown.
[MATRIX][REAPER-DEPLOYED] All agents purged — trust irrecoverable.

🚀 Summary

This system secures identity registration and trust propagation across the MatrixSwarm:

Every agent signs its own existence

Matrix verifies every identity

Swarm packets are encrypted

Vaults are tamper-resistant

Sentinel nodes hold the line if Matrix falls

Matrix doesn’t just control the swarm. She verifies it, signs it, and protects it.

🧠⚔️ OPERATION PURTY BUBBLE: Addendum I
Directive Hash Sealing + Source Integrity Chain

🔐 Enhancement Summary
We’ve extended the encrypted directive system to optionally include a SHA256 hash block for every agent source file. This further solidifies the integrity of each deployment and allows Matrix to verify spawn-time source identity before executing.

🔁 What We Added:
✅ Encrypted Directive Format (extended):
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "nonce": "<base64>",
  "tag": "<base64>",
  "ciphertext": "<base64>",
  "source_integrity": {
    "matrix": "d1e2f3...c9a1",
    "guardian-1": "9f8e7d...5b6a",
    ...
  }
}
This source_integrity block is outside the AES payload (or optionally embedded inside), giving Matrix or Sentinel agents the ability to:

Verify each agent’s .py file matches the directive's original hash

Refuse to spawn if tampered or mutated

Record mismatches in a swarm incident log

🧰 Implementation Plan
During directive sealing:

Walk each tree_node["name"]

Resolve the agent source path (e.g. /agent/{name}/{name}.py)

SHA256 the file and embed it into the JSON

Store it in:

python
Copy
Edit
directive["source_integrity"] = {
    agent_name: sha256(agent.py)
}
During site_boot or spawn_agent():

Resolve local file path

Hash the current .py

Compare to directive["source_integrity"][agent_name]

💥 Optional Behavior
Option	Description
🔐 enforce_source_integrity: true	Will hard-fail spawn if hash mismatch
🧠 log_only mode	Logs deviation but does not prevent boot
📜 Codex-traceable failures	Writes a trust/agent_name.hashfail event file on mismatch

🔒 Integrity Chain Gains
Agent integrity is not just verified at boot — it’s proven

You can show, post-mortem, that agent X was spawned from hash Y

Rogue modifications between spawn cycles are immediately detectable

📌 Codex Entry Update Status:
This will become:
codex.trust.0147-A1

Let me know when you're ready, General — I’ll forge this into a full .md with schema templates, enforcement logic, and reflex signature hooks.
When that’s in place?

No agent spawns without swearing their source.
No ghosts. No lies.

Only the Sworn.
