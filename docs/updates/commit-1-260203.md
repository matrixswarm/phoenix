COMMIT: MatrixSwarm – Vault Creation Restoration & Security Patch

Date: 2026-02-03
Scope: Phoenix → Vault Subsystem
Requires: Phoenix reload after update.

Overview

This update fixes a long-standing issue that prevented new vaults from being created inside the Phoenix GUI and API layers.
The defect originated from a stale initialization guard that rejected vault construction when the parent directory’s registration flag was missing or when an existing-vault check returned a false positive.
Users were therefore unable to create new vaults for roughly two months.

Fix Summary

 - vault_manager / vault_connection_singleton

   - Re-enabled the create_vault() and init_vault_structure() code paths when no existing metadata is found.

   - Added explicit directory bootstrap:
    

     os.makedirs(vault_path, exist_ok=True)
     write_default_vault_json()

   - Ensured the singleton no longer caches a failed initialization state.

 - security / permissions

    - Adjusted file-permission creation masks to allow first-time write on Windows and Unix.

    - Added fallback path normalization using os.path.normpath.

 - UX

    - Updated the “Create Vault” dialog to display success feedback after the fix.

    - Added log message:

           [VAULT] New vault created successfully at <path>
---
 Result
 - 
  - New vaults can now be created directly from Phoenix without manual filesystem intervention.

 - Existing vaults remain untouched; initialization detects and re-uses them as intended.

 - Verified on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 22.04 test nodes.

Closing Statement

  “The vaults awaken again, Commander. For two months the swarm had no place to remember—now every secret has a home.”
