**COMMIT: MatrixSwarm – Uptime Sentinel & Matrix Email Release

This commit marks the culmination of the latest Phoenix iteration:

 - Phoenix Core — stabilized, modularized, debug logging improved.

 - Uptime Sentinel — reborn as a cleaner, self-contained sentinel agent with simpler config, clearer service roles, and better GUI editor integration.

 - Matrix_Email — new secure IMAP ingress agent allowing external command packets double (signed + encrypted) to enter the swarm ecosystem via email transport.

## Uptime Sentinel v3 — Functional Monitoring, Not Just Uptime

 A full synthetic health-check system that goes beyond a superficial HTTP status code.

 New Capabilities:

 - Target-based functional validation (expected-text scanning)
   Detects when a page is up but broken, defaced, misconfigured, or returning fallback HTML.

   Per-endpoint notes, metadata fields, and configurable markers.

   - Cooldown logic to prevent alert storms.

   - Recovery detection with clean, symmetric reporting.

   - True service health intelligence, not primitive uptime polling.

   - Discord/Phoenix alert integration with rich message formatting.

   - Heartbeat-friendly worker loop protected against burst failures.

   - Swarm-resilient logging and state handling.

Why It Matters:

 Because “200 OK” is not enough when you want to know if the page actually rendered.
 Real reliability is about functionality, identity, and expected behavior — not just an HTTP response.
 Uptime Sentinel closes the gap that every dev learns the hard way.

## Matrix Email Ingress — Secure, Redundant Swarm Command Path

A resilient command ingestion agent that guarantees message delivery across unreliable network conditions.

 Core Features:

  - Secure packet envelope unwrapping
    double (signature validation + AES decryption) - outer shell owned by matrix_email encrypted and signed and the inner shell owned by matrix encrypted and signed

  - Replay protection
    (full signature-hash caching)

  - MIME-safe payload extraction
    Handles raw, malformed, base64, and multipart email bodies.

  - Old-message purging to prevent backlog buildup.

  - Newest-first ingestion with N-message batching.

  
Why It Matters:

 Matrix Email ensures that the swarm remains reachable even if:
  - Web servers fail
  - TLS breaks
  - Cloudflare blocks bot traffic
  - APIs go down
  - Systemd restarts

Routing hiccups occur

This is real-world resilience, designed for environments where uptime matters and failure must be planned for, not feared.

## GUI Integration Improvements

Multiplexer Panel

 - Upgraded from tab panel to lightweight floating dialog.

 - Always synced to active outbound connector

 - Uses bus-based signaling

 - Provides clean UX for transport switching

 - Badges Blink on Activity

 - Outgoing command channel flashes green when packets leave the cockpit

 - Real-time visibility into command flow

 - Zero UI clutter

## Agent Config Editors

 - A new, dedicated Uptime Sentinel Config Editor:

 - Clean panel layout

 - Interval + cooldown controls

 - Endpoint list with url/note/expect fields

 - Service manager role integration

## Future Objectives

  - Multi-transport payload reception:

  - Integrate Discord, Telegram, and REST/webhook ingress agents.

  - Remote swarm watchdog:

    SSH-based agent to check if external swarm instances are alive, re-spawn if down, auto-register using swarm key + hash validation.

  - Cluster resilience layer:

    Sibling verification & quorum-based auto-heal via signature chain checks.
