Fix: Correct IMAP username normalization in email_check agent

- Added defensive check in _normalize_imap_username() to prevent
  accidental domain duplication when incoming_username already contains '@'.
- When a username includes a domain, return it verbatim (normalized casing only).
- Only append domain when username is bare (no '@').
- Improved fallback domain inference from incoming_server (mail.xyz.com → xyz.com).
- Ensures Phoenix UI and email_check agent agree on IMAP usernames.
- Fixes long-standing issue where agent attempted to log in as
  'user@example.com@example.com'.

- matrix_https.py removed inline comments, I had "maybe required certs" no "all required"
