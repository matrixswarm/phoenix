Module: Agent Source Utilities

This module provides utility functions and constants for managing agent source files within a secure application framework.
It includes functionality for resolving agent source paths, embedding agent sources into directives, and embedding a cryptographic
hashbang for integrity verification.

Constants:
    - LANG_EXT_MAP: A mapping of programming languages to their corresponding file extensions.

Functions:
    - resolve_agent_source: Resolves the path to a specific agent source file in the `/agents` directory.
    - embed_agent_sources: Embeds source files of all required agents into a given directive.
    - set_hash_bang: Adds a cryptographic hashbang to ensure the integrity of an agent-based directive.

        "python": "py",

    Resolves the file path to an agent source file within the `/agents` directory.

    This function searches for a source file matching the provided agent's name and language. It uses `LANG_EXT_MAP` to determine
    the appropriate file extension based on the specified language.

    Parameters:
        agent_name (str): Name of the agent to locate (e.g., "gatekeeper").
        agents_dir (str): Path to the `/agents` directory where the agent sources are expected to be located.
        lang (str): Programming language of the agent (default is "python").

    Returns:
        str: The absolute path to the resolved agent source file if found, or an empty string if the file is not found.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the `/agents` directory does not exist or cannot be accessed.

    Example:
        >>> resolve_agent_source("gatekeeper", "/project/agents", "python")

    Embeds the source files for all agents referenced in the provided directive into the directive itself.

    This function scans the directive for agent names, attempts to resolve their source file paths, and embeds the contents of those
    files into the directive. This ensures that all required agent files are bundled directly into the directive for portability and security.

    Parameters:
        directive (dict): The directive object, structured as a dictionary, containing the agent references to process.
        base_path (str): The base path where the `/agents` directory is located.

    Returns:
        None: The `directive` is modified in place with embedded source files.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If an agent source file cannot be found.
        ValueError: If the directive structure is invalid or missing required fields.
