## Phoenix Cockpit

(from the MatrixSwarm ecosystem)

Phoenix Cockpit is the secure command bridge for the MatrixSwarm.
It‚Äôs not a toy GUI ‚Äî it‚Äôs the operator‚Äôs deck: unlock the vault, connect to deployments, command the swarm, and watch the agents breathe.

Built with PyQt5.

- Enforces vault unlock ‚Üí command flow (no unlocked vault, no ops).

- Visualizes universes, deployments, agents, and their threads.

- Streams logs, status, and service responses in real time.

- Every packet verified, every heartbeat tracked. 
---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Install
````bash
pip install -e .
````
### Unlock Vault

When Phoenix starts, you‚Äôll see only the üîê UNLOCK button.
Enter your vault password ‚Äî the cockpit decrypts and loads trusted deployments.
No unlock = no swarm control.

#### Connect to Deployment

Right-click a deployment ‚Üí üîå Connect.
Agents will light up in the tree.

#### Issue Commands

- Right-click an agent ‚Üí restart, replace, hotswap, or delete. note: restart and hotswap are being refactored and will be implemented shortly 

- Use control panels (logs, NPC panel, forensic panel) to issue service requests.

- All commands travel securely:

```nginx
 Phoenix ‚Üí matrix_https ‚Üí Matrix ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí WebSocket Relay ‚Üí Phoenix

Click an agent ‚Üí inspect threads, spawn count, flip-tripping alerts, and configuration.

### Creating a Deployment Directive in Phoenix

1. **Start from a Template**  
   Load a directive skeleton in Directive Manager (guardian ring, relays, watchdogs).

2. **Assign Connections**  
   Use Connection Manager to map saved endpoints (HTTPS, WSS, Discord, Telegram, etc.).

3. **Select Options**  
   - **Clown-car** (embed sources in directive) ‚Üí hidden by default.  
   - **Hashbang** (SHA256 hash per agent, verified on spawn) ‚Üí optional.  

4. **Encrypt and Save**

   "universe" is whatever you call your swarm(cluster of agents) at boot
   
   Phoenix encrypts your directive into:  
matrix/boot_directives/<universe>.enc.json   # (relative to project root)

5. **Swarm Key**  
Phoenix also saves the matching swarm key:    
matrix/boot_directives/keys/<universe>.key     # (relative to project root)
*Same name as directive, minus `.enc.json`.* 
 
6. **Boot the Swarm**  
Run:  
```bash
  matrixd boot --universe phoenix
````
Matrix auto-resolves the directive + key, decrypts in memory, and spawns the agents slice by slice.

### Security Principles

- Vault key exists only in memory during session.
- No fallback configs, no plaintext state.
- TLS with SPKI pinning for HTTPS/WSS connections.
- Every packet cryptographically signed.
- Punji traps enforce singleton agents.

### Architecture
- Phoenix GUI (PyQt5)

    - Unlocks vault

    - Displays deployments + agent tree

    - Sends cmd_service_request via HTTPS

- MatrixSwarm Core

    - Routes packets to agents by service role

- Agents

    - Do their jobs (watchdog, oracle, npc-simulator, forensic)

    - Respond back with dict packets

- WebSocket Relay

    - Broadcasts responses to Phoenix
