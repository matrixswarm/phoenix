## Phoenix Cockpit

(from the MatrixSwarm ecosystem)

Phoenix Cockpit is the secure command bridge for the MatrixSwarm/MatrixOs.
It‚Äôs not a toy GUI ‚Äî it‚Äôs the operator‚Äôs deck: unlock the vault, connect to deployments, command the swarm, and watch the agents breathe.

Built with PyQt5.

* Enforces vault unlock ‚Üí command flow (no unlocked vault, no ops).
* Visualizes universes, deployments, agents, and their threads.
* Streams logs, status, and service responses in real time.
* Every packet verified, every heartbeat tracked.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Install

```bash
  pip install -e .
```

### Unlock Vault

When Phoenix starts, you‚Äôll see only the üîê UNLOCK button.
Enter your vault password ‚Äî the cockpit decrypts and loads trusted deployments.
No unlock = no swarm control.

#### Connect to Deployment

Right-click a deployment ‚Üí üîå Connect.
Agents will light up in the tree.

#### Issue Commands

* Right-click an agent ‚Üí restart, replace, hotswap, or delete. note: restart and hotswap are being refactored and will be implemented shortly.
* Use control panels (logs, NPC panel, forensic panel) to issue service requests.
* All commands travel securely:

```nginx
 Phoenix ‚Üí matrix_https ‚Üí Matrix ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí WebSocket Relay ‚Üí Phoenix
```

### üåå Example Session

### Creating a Deployment Directive in Phoenix

1. **Start from a Template**
   Load a directive skeleton in Directive Manager (guardian ring, relays, watchdogs).

2. **Assign Connections**
   Use Connection Manager to map saved endpoints (HTTPS, WSS, Discord, Telegram, etc.).

3. **Select Options**

   * **Clown-car** (embed sources in directive) ‚Üí hidden by default.
   * **Hashbang** (SHA256 hash per agent, verified on spawn) ‚Üí optional.

4. **Encrypt and Save**

   "universe" is whatever you call your swarm(cluster of agents) at boot.

   Phoenix encrypts your directive into:
   `matrix/boot_directives/<universe>.enc.json`

5. **Swarm Key**
   Phoenix also saves the matching swarm key:
   `matrix/boot_directives/keys/<universe>.key`
   *Same name as directive, minus `.enc.json`.*

6. **Boot the Swarm**
   Run:

```bash
  matrixd boot --universe phoenix
```

Matrix auto-resolves the directive + key, decrypts in memory, and spawns the agents slice by slice.

## üöÄ Deploying a Swarm with Phoenix Cockpit

Follow these steps to go from template ‚Üí directive ‚Üí encrypted swarm boot.

### 1. Edit Your Directive Template

* Templates live under:

  ```
  root/boot_directives/{template_name}.py
  ```
* Add or remove agents to fit your deployment (sentinels, watchdogs, NPC simulator, relays, etc.).
* Configure tags such as:

  * `packet_signing`
  * `connection` (https, wss, discord, telegram, openai, etc.)
  * `connection_cert`
* Example template structure: see `phoenix-02.py`.

### 2. Unlock or Create a Vault

* Start Phoenix Cockpit.
* Open or create a vault ‚Üí this is where encrypted directives and swarm keys will be stored.
* No unlocked vault = no deployment.

### 3. Define Your Connections

* Open **Connections** in Phoenix.
* Add endpoints for HTTPS, WebSocket, Discord, Telegram, OpenAI, Slack, etc.
* Each connection will get a label and serial so it can be matched later.

### 4. Build a Directive

* Go to **Directives**.
* **Load** the template you edited in step 1.
* **Save** it under a clear label (this will show up in your saved directives list).

### 5. Deploy a Directive

* Select the saved directive.
* **Deploy** ‚Üí give the deployment a name (must match the `universe` field inside your template).
* Assign connections:

  * Phoenix will prompt you to match each connection tag in the directive (`https`, `wss`, `discord`, etc.) to a saved connection in your vault.
* Optionally preview the directive before encryption.

### 6. Encryption & Swarm Key

* Phoenix encrypts the directive and stores it as:

  ```
  boot_directives/<universe_name>.enc.json
  ```
* It also saves the swarm key:

  ```
  boot_directives/<universe_name>/keys/<universe_name>.key
  ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Secure the swarm key.

```bash
chmod 600 boot_directives/<universe_name>/keys/<universe_name>.key
```

### 7. Boot the Swarm

From the command line:

```bash
matrixd boot --universe <universe_name>
```

Matrix auto-resolves the directive + key, decrypts them in memory, and spawns the agents slice by slice.

‚úÖ **Example Output**

```
Directive: C:\Users\pete\PycharmProjects\phoenix_gui\boot_directives\zzzz.enc.json
Swarm Key: /matrix/boot_directives/keys/zzzz.key
```

Once this is in place, your cockpit, logs, and panels will reflect the active swarm.

### Security Principles

* Vault key exists only in memory during session.
* No fallback configs, no plaintext state.
* TLS with SPKI pinning for HTTPS/WSS connections.
* Every packet cryptographically signed.
* Punji traps enforce singleton agents.

### Architecture

* Phoenix GUI (PyQt5)

  * Unlocks vault
  * Displays deployments + agent tree
  * Sends cmd_service_request via HTTPS
* MatrixSwarm Core

  * Routes packets to agents by service role
* Agents

  * Do their jobs (watchdog, oracle, npc-simulator, forensic)
  * Respond back with dict packets
* WebSocket Relay

  * Broadcasts responses to Phoenix

### Install Phoenix as a Desktop App

```bash
  pip install -e .
  phoenix
```
